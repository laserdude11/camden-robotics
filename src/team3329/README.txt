NOTES ON 2012Season CODE

ON UNITS OF MEASURE:

LENGTH
--------
the standard unit for length in this code is inches. Therefore
    to represent feet you must convert to inches. There are no classes for this
    conversion as that it will take to long.

TIME
-------
the standard unit for time is seconds unless otherwise stated. The metric system
    is used for the conversion of time (i.e.: s --> ms )
